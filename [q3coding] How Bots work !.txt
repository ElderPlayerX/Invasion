Subject: [q3coding] Re: [q3coding]A difference in 1.17 ?(my bots seem to
work differently)



|     I have two new items that Bots were searching for and finding
perfectly
| when using 1.16 but, now after the code has been updated to 1.17, the bots
| will only search and find the one new item and for some reason the other

the
| "botfiles" code is handled was changed.  The item that the bots are
finding
| is directly given to them as a "goal" but, the other item I added like it
| was any other item.  The bots used to find it and grab it perfectly in
1.16
| but, not anymore...
|
| I've wasted hours looking for an answer already, pffffffffffffffffffff
| Has anyone here had success with adding a new item and having the bots
find
| it pick it up?


I never tried to implement it on Q3, but Gladiator Bots for Q2 (which are
actually using the same code as Q3's) I had success on this.


You know those '.c' and '.h' files that are in 'botfiles' directory?


They are actually defining known to bot items and are compiled on every bot
library init when you add a bot in Q2, or on map load in Q3 by game system
(non-user-modifyable part).


Look around, 'items.c' describes all of that.
Also there're in 'weapons.c' all described weapons that bot will use and
count their tactics.


For example:
If you change radius of rocket launcher to zero (in 'botfiles/weapons.c'),
then you'll probably never see again bot firing rockets in hallways where it
thinks enemy is or near that spot. (Unless it's a hack in bot library).


Set BFG explosion radius and damage there to, say, 1024. Bot will never aim
BFG the same way. It will aim to take as much enemies as possible. According
to information it was given of lethality and scale of this weapon.


Change railgun projectile speed from zero (instant hit) to, say, speed of
rocket. Bot will extrapolate your position from speed it knows and will fire
forward you (and will miss) as it was firing rocket.



Chao.
