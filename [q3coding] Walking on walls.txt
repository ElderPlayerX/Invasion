Emmanuel,


I'll be releasing source when I'm done, but to get you started, here's what 
I'm doing.


I'm keeping a normal (up) vector for the player.  Whenever I do a ground trace,
I update the normal with the result of the trace.  So, when everything is done, 
the player model will "magically" orient themselves to the floor.  The other
change I am doing is going through the code and changing anything that refers
to velocity[2], or such to being a dot product onto the normal.  


In my current code I can walk up any slope as long as it doesn't exceed the 
id-defined maximum.  In other words, you will keep sticking to the floor 
if the slope is gradual enough, and the wall will become your new floor.  I've
figured out how to change the view angles (finally - thanks guys), so the
view should orient around the normal properly soon too. :)  The key is to 
not rewrite the existing code.  The only functions that I am changing
drastically are the AnglesToAxes (and one other) to take into account the
normal, and apply an additional roll rotation at the start.  Other code I've
looked at such as MatrixQuake does this differently with special
updateViewAngles code that has a tonne of special cases for the type of wall
you are on. (too complicated for me)


One other tip.  You aren't going to be able to make this mod server-side
only.  If you can remember back to the original quakeworld, and playing 
CTF with the grapple, you always ended up with wierd bobbing going on.  
If you avoid updating the client-side, you will get the bobbing with this mod,
since the client will think that the player should be "falling" when on the
ceiling. :)


Here's something.  While it appears that the int's in the playerstate_t are 
unsigned longs, when they are transmitted to the client, the integer ends up
having FFFF in the high-order bits instead of the actual data.  Anyone have
any ideas?


Good luck!
Jason
